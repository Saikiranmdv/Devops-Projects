# DevOps Projects for Learning

This repository exists to help me **learn DevOps by building real, endâ€‘toâ€‘end projects**. Instead of only reading or watching tutorials, Iâ€™m turning concepts into handsâ€‘on labs and miniâ€‘systems that I can run locally or in the cloud.

> If youâ€™re here to learn tooâ€”welcome! Feel free to fork, open issues, and suggest improvements.

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals

* Build practical projects that cover the DevOps lifecycle: **plan â†’ code â†’ build â†’ test â†’ release â†’ deploy â†’ operate â†’ monitor**
* Practice automation, reproducibility, and observability
* Document what I learn so futureâ€‘me (and others) can reuse it

## ðŸ§° Tech Iâ€™m Practicing

* **Containers & Orchestration:** Docker, Docker Compose, Kubernetes (k3d/kind)
* **IaC:** Terraform (AWS/Azure/GCP), basic CloudFormation/Bicep when useful
* **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions (primary), plus examples with GitLab CI
* **Config Mgmt:** Ansible basics for provisioning
* **Monitoring/Logging:** Prometheus, Grafana, Loki
* **Security/DevSecOps:** image scanning, SAST/Dependabot, secrets management
* **Cloud:** AWS focus; some Azure/GCP experiments
